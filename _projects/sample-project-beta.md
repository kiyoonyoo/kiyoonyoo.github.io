## Project Summary

The **Beta Project** focused on applying advanced NLP techniques to unstructured data within electronic health records (EHRs). The goal was to identify trends, predict patient risk factors, and support clinical decision-making while adhering to strict data privacy regulations.

### Core Functionalities:
*   Named Entity Recognition for medical terms.
*   Relation Extraction between symptoms and diagnoses.
*   Anonymization of sensitive patient data.

The project successfully delivered a prototype system that demonstrated significant potential in analyzing large volumes of clinical notes. It concluded in September 2023.
