## Project Overview

The **Alpha Project** aims to leverage cutting-edge AI and satellite imagery to provide real-time monitoring of deforestation in critical regions. We are developing a deep learning model capable of identifying changes in forest cover with high accuracy.

### Key Objectives:
*   Develop a robust model for deforestation detection.
*   Integrate with satellite data providers.
*   Create a user-friendly dashboard for visualization.

Further details about methodology, expected impact, and current progress will be updated as the project progresses.
This project is currently in the active development phase.
